<h1>The Best Movies According to Mr. Otis</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Alien: Romulus</h3>
<p>
  When Ridley Scott released “Prometheus” and “Alien: Covenant,” the main
  criticism levied against them essentially boiled down to that they didn’t
  provide the same kind of sci-fi thrills as “Alien” and “Aliens,” two of the
  most beloved films of all time. Anyone who dislikes those films because they
  have too much philosophy and not enough acidic alien spit will be satisfied by
  Fede Alvarez’s “Alien: Romulus,” a movie with so many callbacks to the entire
  series (even both Fincher’s “Alien 3” and William Gibson’s unproduced script
  for that film have echoes here, as do the prequels) that they sometimes feel
  like extra weight on this movie spaceship. Luckily, Alvarez’s skill with pace
  and use of setting, along with his obvious love for this series, keep
  “Romulus” afloat. It’s fun, tense, and slimy. It’s also nowhere near as
  ambitious as some of the films in this series deemed failures. We can’t have
  everything.

<h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>
<p>
  “Deadpool & Wolverine” exists because Hugh Jackman, who has played Wolverine
  nine times and had supposedly retired the character after 2017’s “Logan,”
  loved the Deadpool series and was friends with star Ryan Reynolds. He wanted
  the mutant with the adamantium claws to team up with the Merc with the Mouth,
  preferably in a buddy movie modeled partly on R-rated 1980s action flicks like
  “48 Hrs.” The end product is true to the spirit of the franchise while pushing
  its self-aware humor and fourth wall-breaks until it all seems like the result
  of a dare: how big can we make the air quotes around “sincerity” while still
  tugging on heartstrings?

<h3>Twisters</h3>
<p>
  Aren’t movies of this summer spinning delightfully vintage vibes? Just
  collectively consider “Mad Max” offshoot “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” seeing
  Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills again through “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,” Kevin
  Costner’s shrewdly old-school Western “Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,”
  the classical inspirational appeal of “Young Woman and The Sea,” the
  screwball-adjacent magnetism of “Hit Man” and you’ll get the flavor.
